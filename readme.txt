GTA Remastered Controls Patch v2

Put 'gta_remastered.prx' at 'ux0:pspemu/seplugins/gta_remastered.prx' and write this line to 'ux0:pspemu/seplugins/game.txt': 'ms0:/seplugins/gta_remastered.prx 1' (Without ')

This patch has been tested for GTA LCS German V1 and GTA VCS German V1. They should work for other regions too. If not, please fix it for me.

Note that this patch does swap R and X for driving. Now you can accelerate with R and use handbrake with X. This way, the use of the right analog stick is cooler

Changelog v2
- Fixed bug where flying planes and helicopters didn't work, because the R trigger was both used for acceleration and rotation.
- Fixed bug where pressing L trigger for slow aiming didn't work.
